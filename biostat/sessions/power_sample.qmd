# Power and Sample Size

## **USING EPI-INFO**

-   Run EPI6 main menu

-   Select EPITABLE CALCULATOR

-   Select SAMPLE, then SAMPLE SIZE

-   Select appropriate study design

## Examples

### Example I

An ophthalmologist wants to know the proportion (p) of a population with defective vision.

-   What is the minimum sample size if the investigator wishes to be 95% certain that the error of estimation is within Â±0.05.

### **Example II**

The incidence of on new breast cancer among women is 150 per 100,000. We want to see if the introduction of a Vitamin dose will reduce the incidence by 20%.

-   How large a sample do we need if we wish a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%?

### **Example III**

A study to manage women of prematurely labour (20 -- 36 wks).

65% of women who use terbutaline alone and 60% who use a combination with metoprolol extend preganancy beyond 36 weeks. Results were not significant at 5% with 200 patients. How large samples per each group if:

1.  Get a larger sample

2.  Twice patients randomized for terbutaline alone

## Study Design

### **Cross-sectional study**

Wedding party, 4000 guests invited. Illness because of food. Need to find the association between food and illness. 20% took pilau and the rest (80%) no pilau. So, ratio of unexposed to exposed = 80:20

-   Guess that 10% case rate among unexposed and we need to detect an odds ratio of at least 2.

### **Cohort study**

In a vaccine trial, patients are randomly given a vaccine or a placebo. The disease among unexposed group is 10%.

-   How many subjects should the study enroll to receive a two-fold reduction in risk associated with immunization.

### **Case-control study**

We want to compare if diarrhea is associated with bottle feeding or not using ca-co design. Mothers with infants cases and without infant cases interviewed about feeding practices. It is expected that about 40% of controls will be bottle-fed. If we want to detect a difference if bottle-feeding was associated with a two-fold increase of diarrhea (OR=2).

-   How many subjects in each group?
